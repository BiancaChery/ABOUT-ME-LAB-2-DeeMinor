      <p>ABOUT ME</p>
      <p> Hello. My name is Dee. I am from Georgia. I graduated Highschool in 2009 and I went to college to study Business and English. Though I did not complete this degree, I was able to get into the work force and have been working from home for the past 7 years doing electrical estimating. My goals include learning to code and web develop. This is a very new skill that I am interested in, as I am a millenial living in the age of technology. Things I do for fun include crafting, reading, maintaing my bilingual skill in Portuguese and spending time with friends and family.
